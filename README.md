# Simple_Calculator created by Ayotomiwa Adekunle
This is a simple calculator which can perform the following operations: add,minus,multiply,divide,square and square root.
It handles all sorts of errors and works just like any calculator.
You may find the logic a little bit difficult to understand and I will now explain.
Each operation except square and square root have their own variables.
The operations are performed in conjuction with what is currently on the display (i.e entry field).
It is done this way so a user may be able to perform continous operations without having to press the equals button.
This program was created with the Tkinter Module and is 100% my work.
